## 🌟 Introduction

This project implements an **end-to-end supply chain analytics solution** that automates data extraction, transformation, and visualization. By leveraging modern automation and analytics tools, we've created a seamless pipeline that processes supply chain data from Gmail triggers through to interactive dashboards.

The system **automatically extracts data** from CSV files received via email, performs **comprehensive statistical analysis**, and presents insights through **interactive dashboards**. This enables real-time monitoring of supply chain KPIs, revenue metrics, and operational efficiency indicators.

### ✨ Key Highlights

- 🚀 **Fully Automated**: From email trigger to dashboard updates
- 📊 **Real-time Analytics**: Live KPI monitoring and tracking
- 💹 **Multi-currency Support**: Automatic USD to INR conversion
- 📈 **Executive Ready**: Professional dashboards for decision-making
- 🔄 **Scalable Pipeline**: Handles growing data volumes effortlessly
